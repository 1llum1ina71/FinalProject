# Hello...

## So if you don't know how to use git that's okay.
## But you need to download and install php.
## You may also want to get a terminal that you can use bash on.
## Once both of these are installed, type the following in the FinalProject directory:
## php -S localhost:8000
## Then go to localhost:8000 on your web browser.
