# ** Hello... **

## So if you don't know how to use git that's okay.
## But you need to download and install php.
## You may also want to get a terminal that you can use bash on.
## Once both of these are installed, type the following in the FinalProject directory:
## php -S localhost:8000
## Then go to localhost:8000 on your web browser.
## I'm using routing for this, so to look at the files go to localhost:8000/menu and localhost:8000/login
## This is just most of the design work for the project. None of the queries have been done, but this is a good template to start from.
## If you have questions ask me on Discord or in class.
